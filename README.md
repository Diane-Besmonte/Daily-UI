## Day 17: Purchase Receipt

Prompt: What was purchased? On what date? How much was the item? And from what source and vendor? Consider other elements such as a customer support info, a tracking number or receipt number, business location/phone number/website, pictures if needed, and any other related elements. 

Tip:  The bottoms and tops of receipts are usually really underutilized. They can be great places to inform customers about upcoming promotions, news, ask for feedback, or promote your social media with a QR code.

## Day 21: Home Monitoring Dashboard

Prompt: Design a home monitoring dashboard. Be creative! What would make a dashboard visually appealing and fun to use, while also being mindful of its function? 
 
Try to make it a realistic exercise as if it were your own dashboard... one that you need to refer to daily. What is the most relevant data and what's the most appropriate placement for it?
 
Output Link: [Home Monitoring Dashboard Page](https://www.figma.com/proto/dGuNgC7KZfhzi9iZyqfUkN/Daily-UI-Challenges?type=design&node-id=308-62&t=0x9LsikyH1SfrLFo-1&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&mode=design)

## Day 23: Onboarding
Prompt: Are you recruiting people for an organization? Are people signing up for a new service or website? Is it welcoming people into a mobile app? 
 
Onboarding might seem trivial, but it's the first experience your users have with your product or service. It's like the first page of a book and it can instantly excite them. If not implemented well, a bad onboarding experience could turn someone off of a brand completely. 
 
Output Link: [Onboarding for TaskMaster](https://www.figma.com/proto/dGuNgC7KZfhzi9iZyqfUkN/Daily-UI-Challenges?type=design&node-id=333-60&t=mKhQiWTug1ZhqBS7-1&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&mode=design)

## Day 24: Boarding Pass
Prompt: Consider the origin, the destination, gates, seats, the airline, etc.

Output Link: [Newsletter Subscription](https://www.figma.com/proto/dGuNgC7KZfhzi9iZyqfUkN/Daily-UI-Challenges?type=design&node-id=362-229&t=tVsJR9kWnhRFTfYI-1&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&mode=design)

## Day 28: Contact Page

Prompt: Is it for customer support? A purchase inquiry? To schedule an appointment? Is it a full page or just a form? Imagine a scenario and the most important feature it would require. 
 
Contact pages are some of the most visited pages on websites so it's important to have the most critical information, but not so much that people get lost.
 
Output Link: [Vivid Visions Website Contact page](https://www.figma.com/proto/dGuNgC7KZfhzi9iZyqfUkN/Daily-UI-Challenges?type=design&node-id=408-45&t=3wo4ieNxl0Wc0qGp-1&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&mode=design)

## Day 30: Pricing

Prompt: Is it a pricing table for a SaaS website? An in-app purchase? Or upgrade options for a restaurant menu?
 
Displaying prices in an easy-to-read format is a good design and business practice. Make the price obvious and don't try to hide anything. Overly complex pricing tables or designs create confusion and consequently a lack of trust… bad for both business and design.
 
Output Link: [Pricing Cards](https://www.figma.com/proto/dGuNgC7KZfhzi9iZyqfUkN/Daily-UI-Challenges?type=design&node-id=445-54&t=VCNNXiu2IV8kT8m9-1&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&mode=design)

## Day 31: File Upload

Prompt: Is it the loading screen and an icon? A progress element? Are folders being uploaded by flying across the screen like Ghostbusters? ;)
 
Would a user need to input additional information such as tax data or attach an image (like an identification card) during the process?
 
Output Link: [File Upload Page](https://www.figma.com/proto/dGuNgC7KZfhzi9iZyqfUkN/Daily-UI-Challenges?type=design&node-id=456-54&t=8gjUcLXDFfmbo7TD-1&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&mode=design)

## Day 32: Crowdfunding

Prompt: Keep in mind the purpose... raising funds. It's important to make a design simple and compelling if you're seeking money. Is it for startups to raise money from investors? (Such as on WeFunder, Republic, StartEngine)
 
Or raising funds for a community cause like funding the restoration of a historical monument?
 
So what's really important? The number of contributors, the total amount raised, campaign details, and highlights? Also consider size, imagery, placement, slogans, etc.

## Day 34: Automotive Interface

## Day 38: Calendar

Prompt: Design a Calendar focused element. Is it for scheduling an appointment? A reservation, flight, hotel, or a health check? Is it a calendar reminder feature? Is it used in email or for something else entirely?
 
It could even be a calendar booking page for design services. Or an interactive online holiday calendar.

## Day 40: Recipe or Food Order

Prompt: Design a food related recipe. It could displayed on a tablet while someone is cooking in their home kitchen or in the back of a restaurant on a Kitchen Display System (aka KDS).
 
Clarity is important because a restaurant or online food ordering service needs to be simple in order to be fast for customers to find what they want and how it can be customized. Confusing menus or recipes slow down the kitchen and the entire business.

## Day 41: Workout / Exercise

Prompt: Create a UI related for monitoring health or tracking various workout/training routines. It could be for a personal workout, for a team, or even gym equipment tracking customer workouts.
 
Making a health app that is fun to use makes the entire experience more enjoyable and therefore more likely to be repeated. 
 
Tip: exercise regularly to get blood and oxygen flowing for health, better sleep, and to boost your creative mood. It's easier to be happy if you're healthy. :)

## Day 46: Invoice

Prompt: Invoices are generally sent for products or services before or after fulfillment. For example, a web designer or software engineer might send an invoice for a new website with 25% as a downpayment and the remainder on completion. 
 
This is not a quote or proposal, so it should have only the required information for payment, services rendered, prices, etc. and ideally a link/button to receive payment. 
 
Tip: An invoice is a nice opportunity to thank a client. Uplifting comments can put clients in a good mood. If you know them in a personal/friendly context, sometimes a meme can help break the ice on making a payment. :)

## Day 50: Job Listing or Hiring Page

Prompt: Who is hiring? What's the position? Where is it located? Are there benefits?

## Day 51: Press Page

Prompt: Create a Press Page design. Think about who you are representing and what important information you should convey. Is it for a new startup? A huge global brand? A nonprofit organization?

## Day 52: Logo Design

Prompt: Will it be animated? In what capacity will it be used?
Branding is generally a serious matter for most companies and the considerations for size, placement, color, etc. should be thought out carefully.
 
The biggest brands don't always have the best logos. A great logo is one that compliments a specific purpose and not necessarily a generic image or name. For example, Nike uses a swoosh which shows motion and speed - core parts of their running image. Mailchimp showcases a monkey rather than an “email” icon and it adds depth and character to their brand. 
 
Good luck 🤩

## Day 56: Breadcrumbs
